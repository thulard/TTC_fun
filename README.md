# Script for the Coqui TTS framework

The [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) framework doesn't handle text file as an input.
This script allow that by slicing the input text into separate tts commands.

It also, reduce the speed slightly for better result (0.95).

TODO: merge the wav files into a single file.
